# Configuration

Global configuration is stored in the YAML file located, by default, at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/orgctl/config.yaml`. However, you can override this with the `$ORGCTL_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable. When this variable is set, it will attempt to load `config.yaml` from the specified directory.
